# **1\. Introduction**

In this guide, we will walk you through deploying a microservices-based e-commerce application, using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We'll start by containerizing the CloudMart backend and frontend using Docker, storing the Docker images in AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and then deploying and managing the application on a production-grade Kubernetes cluster with EKS. Along the way, weâ€™ll cover essential security practices, automation workflows, and cost management strategies, ensuring a smooth, secure, and scalable deployment.

## **1.1 Architecture Overview**

The CloudMart application implements a modern microservices architecture deployed on Amazon EKS.

This infrastructure leverages AWS's multi-AZ capability for high availability, with the application load balancer distributing traffic across private subnets in three availability zones. The EKS worker nodes are strategically placed in private subnets for enhanced security, while maintaining public accessibility through the ALB."

Before we begin the deployment, let's understand our implementation approach. We'll start with containerization using Docker, packaging both our frontend and backend applications. This containerization ensures consistency across environments and simplifies our deployment process. Once our applications are containerized, we'll move on to orchestrating them with Kubernetes on AWS EKS.

# **2\. Docker**

In Part 2, we begin by setting up Docker on an EC2 instance, which serves as our foundation for containerization. We then create Docker images for both components of our two-tier application. The backend, built on Node.js, requires specific configurations for AWS services like Bedrock and includes environment variables for API keys and service endpoints. The frontend, a React application, is containerized using a multi-stage build process to optimize the final image size and performance. Both services are configured with specific ports - 5000 for the backend and 5001 for the frontend.

## **2.1 Install Docker on EC2**

Execute the following commands to install and configure Docker on your EC2 instance:

```plaintext
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo docker run hello-world
sudo systemctl enable docker
docker --version
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
newgrp docker
```

* Success Indicator: Docker should be installed and running.
    
* Verification Command: `docker --version`

With our applications successfully containerized, we can now focus on setting up our production environment using AWS EKS. This section will guide you through creating a production-grade Kubernetes cluster and deploying our containerized applications with proper networking, security, and scaling configurations.

# **3\. Kubernetes**

We start by setting up a production-grade cluster with the necessary tooling: eksctl for cluster management and kubectl for Kubernetes operations. The cluster is configured with t3.medium nodes and OIDC authentication, along with IAM integration for pod-level AWS service access. This setup is crucial for services like DynamoDB and Bedrock that our application depends on.

The deployment process begins with the backend, using Amazon ECR for container image hosting. The Kubernetes configuration includes specific pod specifications with service account integration for AWS service access, environment variable configuration, and a LoadBalancer service type for external accessibility. The frontend deployment follows a similar pattern but requires additional configuration to dynamically connect with the backend service.

# 7\. Cleanup Resources

After completing the deployment and testing, proper resource management becomes crucial. While the EKS cluster can be maintained between sessions for continued development, users should carefully consider the cost implications. AWS charges will accrue as long as the cluster remains active, so it's important to either delete unused resources or budget for ongoing cluster availability.

The provided cleanup procedures help ensure no unnecessary resources remain active, supporting both cost efficiency and resource management best practices in your production-ready e-commerce deployment.

```plaintext
kubectl delete service cloudmart-frontend-service
kubectl delete deployment cloudmart-frontend
kubectl delete service cloudmart-backend-service
kubectl delete deployment cloudmart-backend
eksctl delete cluster --name cloudmart --region us-east-1
```

These steps ensure that all resources related to the CloudMart application are properly cleaned up from the cluster.

## 7\. Security Best Practices

1. IAM and Authentication
    
    * Use least-privilege permissions for service accounts
        
    * Regularly rotate credentials and review access policies
