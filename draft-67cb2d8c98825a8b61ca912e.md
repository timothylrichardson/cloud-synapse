TL;DR: Discover how to deploy CloudMart, a microservices-based e-commerce application, using Docker and Kubernetes on AWS EKS. This guide includes steps for containerization, storing images in AWS ECR, managing with Amazon EKS, and implementing infrastructure automation and security best practices.

### **Abstract**

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying CloudMart, a modern microservices-based e-commerce application, using Docker and Kubernetes on AWS. We will containerize the application, store it in AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and manage it with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

### **Keywords**

Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EKS, Infrastructure Automation, Microservices, CI/CD, Security Best Practices

# **1\. Introduction**

In this guide, we will walk you through deploying CloudMart, a microservices-based e-commerce application, using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We'll start by containerizing the CloudMart backend and frontend using Docker, storing the Docker images in AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and then deploying and managing the application on a production-grade Kubernetes cluster with EKS. Along the way, weâ€™ll cover essential security practices, automation workflows, and cost management strategies, ensuring a smooth, secure, and scalable deployment.

## **1.1 Architecture Overview**

The CloudMart application implements a modern microservices architecture deployed on Amazon EKS.

This infrastructure leverages AWS's multi-AZ capability for high availability, with the application load balancer distributing traffic across private subnets in three availability zones. The EKS worker nodes are strategically placed in private subnets for enhanced security, while maintaining public accessibility through the ALB."

# **2\. Docker**

In Part 2, we begin by setting up Docker on an EC2 instance, which serves as our foundation for containerization. We then create Docker images for both components of our two-tier application. The backend, built on Node.js, requires specific configurations for AWS services like Bedrock and includes environment variables for API keys and service endpoints. The frontend, a React application, is containerized using a multi-stage build process to optimize the final image size and performance. Both services are configured with specific ports - 5000 for the backend and 5001 for the frontend.

## **2.1 Install Docker on EC2**

Execute the following commands to install and configure Docker on your EC2 instance:

```plaintext
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo docker run hello-world
sudo systemctl enable docker
docker --version
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
newgrp docker
```

* Success Indicator: Docker should be installed and running.
    
* Verification Command: `docker --version`
    

## **2.2 Create Docker Images for CloudMart**

## Step 2: Create Docker Images for CloudMart

### Backend Setup

```plaintext
# Set up backend directory and source code
mkdir -p challenge-day2/backend && cd challenge-day2/backend
wget https://tcb-public-events.s3.amazonaws.com/mdac/resources/day2/cloudmart-backend.zip
unzip cloudmart-backend.zip

# Create both configuration files in one step
cat > .env << EOL
PORT=5000
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
BEDROCK_AGENT_ID=<your-bedrock-agent-id>
BEDROCK_AGENT_ALIAS_ID=<your-bedrock-agent-alias-id>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<your-openai-assistant-id>
EOL

cat > Dockerfile << EOL
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
EOL
```

### **Frontend Setup**

1. Create a frontend folder and download the source code
    

```plaintext
# Set up frontend directory and source code
cd ../
mkdir frontend && cd frontend
wget https://tcb-public-events.s3.amazonaws.com/mdac/resources/day2/cloudmart-frontend.zip
unzip cloudmart-frontend.zip

# Create Dockerfile with multi-stage build configuration
cat > Dockerfile << EOL
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g serve
COPY --from=build /app/dist /app
ENV PORT=5001 NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 5001
CMD ["serve", "-s", ".", "-l", "5001"]
EOL
```

* Success Indicator: The frontend folder should contain the source code files.
    
* Verification Command: `ls`
    

2\. Create a Dockerfile

```plaintext
nano Dockerfile
```

* Success Indicator: Dockerfile should be present in the frontend folder.
    
* Verification Command: `ls`
    

3\. Add the following containerization configuration to the Dockerfile

```plaintext
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g serve
COPY --from=build /app/dist /app
ENV PORT=5001
EXPOSE 5001
CMD ["serve", "-s", ".", "-l", "5001"]
```

# **3\. Kubernetes**

With our applications containerized, weâ€™ll focus on Kubernetes deployment using Amazon EKS. We start by setting up a production-grade cluster with the necessary tooling: eksctl for cluster management and kubectl for Kubernetes operations. The cluster is configured with t3.medium nodes and OIDC authentication, along with IAM integration for pod-level AWS service access. This setup is crucial for services like DynamoDB and Bedrock that our application depends on.

The deployment process begins with the backend, using Amazon ECR for container image hosting. The Kubernetes configuration includes specific pod specifications with service account integration for AWS service access, environment variable configuration, and a LoadBalancer service type for external accessibility. The frontend deployment follows a similar pattern but requires additional configuration to dynamically connect with the backend service.
